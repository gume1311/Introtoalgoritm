# concepts and characteristics of algorithms

 Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. 
 
 Unambiguous − Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.

Input − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.

Output − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.

Finiteness − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.

Feasibility − Should be feasible with the available resources.

Independent − An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code

## SIMPLE SELECTIVE STRUCTURE (IF - END IF)
 
 La estructura de selección simple evalúa una condición, si ésta es verdadera ejecuta una o varias instrucciones, si es falsa continua la ejecución normal del programa.

##  types of computational data.

### Numerical data
Numeric data is any data where the data points are exact numbers. Statisticians can also call numerical data, quantitative data.


### Categorical data
Categorical data represent characteristics.

### Character string.

It is an ordered sequence of arbitrary length (although finite) of elements that belong to a certain formal language or alphabet; analogous to a phrase or a sentence.

### variables
In programming, a variable is made up of a space in the storage system and a symbolic name that is associated with that space.

### constant
In programming, a constant is a value that cannot be altered / modified during the execution of a program, it can only be read.


# computational operations

## Arithmetic

one where the operators involved in it are numeric, the result is a number and the operators are arithmetic

### logic
a type of programming paradigm within the declarative programming paradigm.
